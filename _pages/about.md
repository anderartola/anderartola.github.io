Welcome! I'm Ander, a PhD. student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org), under the supervision of [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/) and as part of the IMPRS-TRUST program. Previously, I obtained my masters in Physics at Heidelberg University under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Bosman](https://sites.google.com/view/sarahbosman). I graduated in 2023 from the Complutense University of Madrid in Mathematics and Physics.

My primary (and past) interests include:
* Machine learning, uncertainty quantification, explainability and support systems
* Bayesian modelling and inference
* Causality
* Decision-making and strategic behavior
* (Differential geometry and its applications)
* (Cosmology, dark matter, the intergalactic medium and reionisation)
* Anything that is intensive in abstract reasoning: from coding to philosophy

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
