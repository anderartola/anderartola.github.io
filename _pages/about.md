Welcome! I'm Ander Artola, a PhD. student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org), under the supervision of [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/) and as part of the IMPRS-TRUST program. Previously, I obtained my masters at Heidelberg University under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Bosman](https://sites.google.com/view/sarahbosman). 

My primary interests include:
* Machine learning, uncertainty quantification, explainability and support systems
* Bayesian modelling
* Statistical inference techniques
* Decision-making 
* Differential geometry and its applications
* Cosmology, dark matter, the intergalic-medium and reionisation
