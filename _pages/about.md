Welcome! I'm Ander Artola, a physics master's student at Heidelberg University under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Bosman](https://sites.google.com/view/sarahbosman). ---
I will be joining the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org) as a PhD. student, under the supervision of [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/) and as part of the IMPRS-TRUST program!

My primary interests are in artificial intelligence, uncertainty quantification, and statistical inference. I am also interested in applying machine learning to problems in physics and cosmology. More generally, I enjoy anything related to mathematics and coding.
