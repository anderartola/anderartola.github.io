My masterâ€™s thesis is complete! Thanks to Heidelberg University (Institute for Theoretical Physics) and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. You can find it [here](/assets/pdf/MASTER_THESIS_ANDER_ARTOLA.pdf). In this project, I use a Bayesian neural network to reconstruct the cosmic density fields from the Lyman-alpha forest. Based on those reconstructions, I constrain warm dark matter with unprecedented efficiency.
