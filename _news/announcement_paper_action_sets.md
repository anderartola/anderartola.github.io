We have recently released a new [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16097)! In the context of sequential decision-making, we develop a decision support system that uses a pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along the way, we also develop a best-arm identification algorithm for Lipschitz bandits suited to our problem.

This work has done with an amazing team at MPI-SWS: Eleni Straitouri, Stratis Tsirtsis and Manuel Gomez Rodriguez.
